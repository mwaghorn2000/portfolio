# My Portfolio
## Find it here [here](https://mitchellwportfolio.com)
### Stack
Used this portfolio as my first exposure to Next.js and Tailwind and realised how fun it is to use the technologies.

The **Blog** ~~is still a work in progress~~ is now complete and even includes a brand new user dashboard, ( for me only ) and can be found on the Blog branch if you wish the view the code. I'll be posting unit reviews, and also my experiences while developing my projects.

## My Dashboard

This is the authentication i added for myself to access my post dashboard. I used cypher to encrypt my password and i store the userinfo on mongodb cloud. Then once i log in the server creates a cookie and stores it in the users browser, which is used to authenticate login beyond the login page. I implemented this method as i wanted experience with Json Web Tokens and client side storage.

### Next.js Middleware
This is when i found out about middleware for ts. It made redirecting unauthenticated users extremely easy and straight forward.

### The _Dashboard_

Its not much but it gets the job done. Here i can access a form to create a new post and update existing posts ( form is prefilled ), and then also delete posts.

### Thats it

There's not really much more going on in the dashboard at the moment. However it was a great experience working with Next.js, MongoDB, and the various other libraries i used for this project, and im confident to tackle a new and more challenging project. Stay tuned.
